abstract = {Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) are often used for environmental and industrial sensing in undersea/ocean space, therefore, these networks are also named underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). Underwater sensor networks are different from other sensor networks due to the acoustic channel used in their physical layer, thus we should discuss about the specific features of these underwater networks such as acoustic channel modeling and protocol design for different layers of open system interconnection (OSI) model. Each node of these networks as a sensor needs to exchange data with other nodes; however, complexity of the acoustic channel makes some challenges in practice, especially when we are designing the network protocols. Therefore based on the mentioned cases, we are going to review general issues of the design of an UASN in this paper. In this regard, we firstly describe the network architecture for a typical 3D UASN, then we review the characteristics of the acoustic channel and the corresponding challenges of it and finally, we discuss about the different layers e.g. MAC protocols, routing protocols, and signal processing for the application layer of UASNs.},

@article{Dou2015,
abstract = {Recently, Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) have attracted increasing attentions from the public as it en- ables a wide range of underwater applications. However, the long propagation delay and high error probability in UWSNs pose grand challenges for efficient and reliable protocol de- signs in time critical applications such as underwater pollu- tion detection. In this paper, we propose a new medium ac- cess control (MAC) protocol, named On-demand Pipelined MAC (OPMAC), for time critical applications in UWSNs. The basic idea of this protocol is to establish an on-demand pipeline so that data could be transmitted from the source to the destination over multiple hops in a short time. A spe- cial acknowledgementmechanism is also designed to guaran- tee the reliability of the communication with low overheads. Analytical results show that OPMAC significantly reduces end-to-end delay and improves energy efficiency.},

abstract = {Underwater wireless sensor network is a novel type of underwater networked system. Due to the characterristics of UWSN and underwater channel, UWSN are vulnerable to malicious attacks. The existing security solutions proposed for WSN cannot be used directly in UWSN. Moreover, most of these solutions are layer wise. In this paper, we studied the threat, attack, and security issues of UWSN. Subsequently, we argue that layered security schemes cannot protect UWSN against blended attacks. Additionally, we presented a novel preliminary conceive, which is a cross-layer, adaptive, selective security scheme. {\&}copy; 2010 IEEE.},

@article{Ibrahim2013,
abstract = {In underwater acoustic sensor network, deploying multiple surface-level radio capable gateways is an efficient way to alleviate the burdens of high propagation delay and high error probability during transmission. However, the locations of gateways need to be carefully selected to maximize the benefit in a cost-effective way. In this paper, we present our formulation of the surface gateway deployment problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) and we solve the problem with heuristic approaches to provide a realtime solution for large scale deployment problems. By applying the proposed heuristic algorithms to a variety of deployment scenarios, we show that they are nearly optimal for practical cases, which opens the door for dynamic deployment. Therefore, we extend our solution to a dynamic case and propose a modified framework that integrates Aqua-sim, a NS2-based underwater wireless sensor network simulator. Our simulation result shows the benefits of dynamic gateway redeployment over static deployment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
