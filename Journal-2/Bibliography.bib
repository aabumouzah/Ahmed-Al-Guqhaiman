@article{Rahman2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Due to the atypical characteristics of the physical media in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UW-ASN)-mostly because of long propagation delay, low bandwidth and high error rate-several challenges arise while designing the MAC protocol. In this paper, we propose a Bidirectional Multi-flow MAC protocol (BMF-MAC) for UW-ASN, to efficiently handle multi-hop multi-flow traffic load patterns such a way that multiple streams of data transmissions concurrently proceed while adapting with varying traffic condition. BMF-MAC supports constitution of multi-hop flows by considering all pending packets in routing layer buffer and all flow setups requests from neighbors when setting up a flow, contrary to other underwater MAC protocols. The proposed MAC introduces a data transmission technique using the bidirectional multi-flow packet method for sending multiple data packets of the same flow in the reverse direction and thus improve channel utilization. The protocol is aimed to schedule more data transmission over multiple multihop flows, thus permitting rapid distribution of data and reduction of latency. Results show that BMF-MAC protocol outperforms existing CMRT protocol in terms of network throughput and packet delivery latency.},

@article{Campagnaro2017,
abstract = {Underwater acoustic communications experiments often in- volve custom implementations of schemes and protocols for the physical and data link layers. However, most commercial modems focus on providing reliable or optimized communi- cation links, rather than on allowing low-level reconfigura- tion or reprogramming of modulation and coding schemes. As a result, the physical layer is typically provided as a closed, non-reprogrammable black box, accessible by the user only through a specific interface. While software-defined modems would be the ultimate solution to overcome this issue, having access to the symbols transmitted by the modems using a proprietary modulation format already opens up a number of research opportunities, e.g., aimed at the cross-layer design and optimization of channel coding schemes and communi- cation protocols. In this paper, we take the latter approach.We consider the commercial EvoLogics modem, driven by a custom firmware version that bypasses the channel coding methods applied by the modem, and allows the user to set the transmit bit rate to any desired value within a given set. This makes it possible to evaluate different coding schemes in the presence of different bit rates. Our results show that the custom firmware offers sufficient flexibility to test different configurations of the coding schemes and bit rates, by providing direct access both to correctly decoded and to corrupted symbols, which can be separated at the receiver for further processing. In addition, we show that the DESERT Underwater framework can also leverage the same flexibility by employing low-level physical layer access in more complex networking experiments.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Association for Computing Machinery. The recent uptake of non-acoustic underwater transmission systems suggests that in the near future it will be common for underwater devices to incorporate different physical communication technologies. Such devices are typically described as multimodal. They seek flexibility by compensating for the shortcomings of a given technology through the advantages of another. For example, a system encompassing acoustic and optical communication systems can provide long-range, lowbit rate communications, while enabling faster data transfer at very short range. As the development of non-acoustic underwater communications is taking momentum, so is the research on how to optimally exploit the multimodal communications capabilities in different scenarios. This paper presents a survey of past and recent work on this topic, covering the development both of the communication technologies and of the networking schemes and protocols for multimodal networks. As an example of the opportunities offered by multimodal communications, we discuss two different case studies. We conclude with an outlook on likely future developments for multimodal communications.},

Our optimization is geared towards obtaining secure communications without affecting network performance by jointly keeping security-related overhead and energy consumption at bay. Implementation and testing experiments have been performed with the SUNSET SDCS framework and its Sec-FUN extension using as hardware two submerged acoustic modems. Results show that our approach imposes a low computational burden to the underwater node, which implies low local energy consumption. This is due to the fact the FHMQV protocol is highly efficient resulting in a small number of operations with a low computation cost.

abstract = {the accuracy of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) navigation system determines whether they can safely operate and return. Traditional Dead-reckoning (DR) relies on the inertial sensors such as gyroscope and accelerometer. A major challenge for DR navigation is from measurement error of the inertial sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, etc.), especially when the AUV is near or at the ocean surface. The AUV's motion is affected by ocean waves, and its pitch angle changes rapidly with the waves. This rapid change and the measurement errors will cause great noise to the direction measured by gyroscopes, and then lead to a large error to the DR navigation. To address this problem, a novel DR method based on neural network (DR-N) is proposed to explore the time-varying relationship between acceleration measurement and orientation measurement, which leverages acoustic localization and neural network estimate timely pitch angle through the explored time-varying relationship. This method enables AUV's DR navigation with a single acceleration, without relying on both acceleration and gyroscope. Most importantly, we can improve the accuracy of AUV navigation through avoiding DR errors caused by gyroscope noise at the sea surface. Simulations show DR-N significantly improves navigation accuracy.},

This mac protocol is an extension of Slotted-Floor Acquisition Multiple Access (S-FAMA). It reserves a channel and divide it into slots where each node has its own slot. The contributions of this paper are by enabling multiple node to handshake at the same time and enable a random access in case a node does have no data to send. This helps to reuse the reserved slot and increases the channel utilization., \textbf{Decision:} Scan. This paper proposed a MAC protocol where several node can communicate simultaneously. The authors also compared their results with similar approach. This will be very useful to build the state of the art of current MAC protocols.}

Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UWASNs) have the wide of applications with the proliferation of the increasing underwater activities recently. Most of current studies are focused on designing protocols to improve the network performance of WASNs. However, the security of UWASNs is also an important concern since malicious nodes can easily wiretap the information transmitted in UWASNs due to the vulnerability of UWASNs. In this paper, we investigate one of security problems in UWASNs - eavesdropping behaviours. In particular, we propose a general model to quantitatively evaluate the probability of eavesdropping behaviour in UWASNs. Simulation results also validate the accuracy of our proposed model.},

@article{Liu2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM. The harsh environment in the water has imposed challenges for underwater sensor networks (USNs), which collect the sensed data from the underwater sensors to the sink on land. The time-varying underwater acoustic channel has low bandwidth and high bit error rate, which leads to low data collection efficiency. Furthermore, the heterogeneous model of USNs that uses acoustic communications under the water and wireless communication above the water makes it difficult in efficient routing and forwarding for data collection. To this end, we propose a novel on-surface wireless-assisted opportunistic routing (SurOpp) for USNs. SurOpp deploys multiple buoy nodes on surface and includes all of them in the forwarding candidates to form a receive diversity. The opportunities of reception and forwarding in buoy nodes are exploited to improve the end-to-end transmissions. SurOpp also adopts rateless codes in the source to achieve opportunistic reception in the sink. The cooperation of both opportunistic reception in the buoys and the sink further decreases the messages of control overhead. The wireless interface in the buoy undertakes all the message exchanges in forwarding coordination to compensate the bandwidth limit of the acoustic channel. Simulations in NS3 show that SurOpp outperforms the traditional routing and existing opportunistic routing in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and energy consumption.},
